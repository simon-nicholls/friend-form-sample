# friend-form-sample

This is a sample Pedestal service project, demonstrating the use of Friend's interactive form workflow.

## Getting Started

1. Start the application: `lein run-dev` \*
2. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see: `Hello World!`
3. Follow the link to the protected page.
4. Login when asked. Try root/clojure as soon as you get bored.
3. Read the app's source code at src/friend_form_sample/service.clj. Explore the docs of functions
   that define routes and responses.

\* `lein run-dev` automatically detects code changes. Alternatively, you can run in production mode
with `lein run`.

## Configuration

To configure logging see config/logback.xml. By default, the app logs to stdout and logs/.
